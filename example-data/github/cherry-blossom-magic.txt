Cherry Blossom Season

When cherry trees bloom, they transform landscapes into cotton candy dreams. In Japan, the tradition of hanami celebrates this fleeting beauty. Families and friends gather under the blossoms for picnics, appreciating the reminder that beautiful things don't last forever.

The blooming period typically lasts only one to two weeks. Wind and rain can shorten it further, making each petal-scattered moment precious. The falling petals, called sakura fubuki or cherry blossom blizzard, are considered as beautiful as the blooms themselves.
