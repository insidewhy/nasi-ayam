Coral Bell Colors

Coral bells, or heucheras, are grown primarily for their stunning foliage rather than their flowers. The leaves come in an artist's palette of colors - deep purple, lime green, caramel orange, silver, and burgundy - often with contrasting veins.

These versatile perennials thrive in shade or partial sun, brightening dark corners of the garden. They're evergreen in mild climates, providing year-round interest. The tiny bell-shaped flowers on tall stalks are a bonus, attracting hummingbirds in spring.
