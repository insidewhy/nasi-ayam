Ferret Fun

Ferrets are chaos incarnate in a long, fuzzy body. They bounce, they dance, they steal your socks. The "war dance" - a sideways hopping, back-arched, mouth-open display - means they're having the time of their lives.

These playful pets love tunnels, hammocks, and anything they can crawl through or hide in. They sleep up to 18 hours a day but pack incredible energy into their waking hours. A bored ferret will find something to do - usually something mischievous.
