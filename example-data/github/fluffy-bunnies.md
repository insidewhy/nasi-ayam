# The Fluffiest Rabbit Breeds

## Angora Rabbits

Angora rabbits are famous for their incredibly soft, fluffy wool. English Angoras have fur covering even their faces and ears, giving them a round, cloud-like appearance. Their wool must be harvested regularly through brushing or shearing to prevent matting.

## Lionhead Rabbits

Named for their distinctive mane of longer fur around their heads, Lionheads are charming small rabbits. Some have a single mane that fades with age, while double-maned varieties keep their fluffy collars for life.

## Jersey Wooly

Jersey Woolies are small rabbits with dense, easy-care wool coats. Unlike Angoras, their wool doesn't mat easily and requires less maintenance. Their compact size and gentle personalities make them popular pets.
