Welcome Wildlife to Your Garden

A garden full of wildlife is a healthy garden. Birds eat pest insects, bees pollinate your vegetables, and butterflies add movement and color. Creating a welcoming habitat brings these beneficial visitors to your yard.

Start with native plants. Local wildlife evolved alongside native vegetation and depends on it for food and shelter. Native plants also require less water and maintenance once established. Even a small patch of natives can make a difference.

Water features attract a surprising variety of creatures. A simple birdbath provides drinking and bathing water for birds. A small pond can support frogs, dragonflies, and visiting mammals. Even a shallow dish with pebbles gives butterflies and bees a place to drink safely.

Provide shelter through varied planting. Evergreen shrubs offer year-round cover. Brush piles give refuge to small animals. Dead trees, if safe to leave standing, provide homes for woodpeckers and owls. A variety of heights and densities serves different species' needs.

Reduce or eliminate pesticide use. These chemicals don't distinguish between pests and beneficial insects. A healthy garden ecosystem usually balances itself - predators control pests naturally. If intervention is needed, choose targeted, organic options.

Leave some areas a little wild. A patch of unmowed grass, fallen leaves under shrubs, and seed heads left standing through winter all provide habitat. Not every inch needs to be manicured for a garden to be beautiful.
