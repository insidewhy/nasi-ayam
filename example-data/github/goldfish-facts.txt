Goldfish Memories

Contrary to popular belief, goldfish have memories lasting months, not seconds. They can learn to navigate mazes, recognize their owners, and even push levers to get food at specific times. These beautiful fish are far more intelligent than most people realize.

Goldfish can live 10-15 years with proper care, and some have reached 40 years or more. They come in many varieties beyond the common orange, including fantails, orandas, and bubble-eyes, each with unique charm.
