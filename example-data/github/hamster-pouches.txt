Hamster Pouches

Hamster cheek pouches can stretch to hold up to 20% of the hamster's body weight in food. That's equivalent to a human carrying several watermelons in their cheeks! These expandable pockets extend from the cheeks back to the shoulders.

In the wild, hamsters use their pouches to transport food to their burrows. Pet hamsters retain this instinct, stuffing their cheeks with treats and then finding hidden spots to stash their treasures.
