# The World of Hummingbirds

Hummingbirds are tiny jewels of the bird world, captivating watchers with their iridescent colors and incredible flying abilities. These remarkable birds are found only in the Americas and bring magic to any garden.

## Amazing Abilities

Hummingbirds are the only birds that can truly hover and fly backwards. Their wings beat 50-80 times per second in normal flight and up to 200 times per second during courtship dives. This rapid movement creates the humming sound that gives them their name.

Despite weighing only 2-20 grams (about as much as a penny to a few grapes), hummingbirds have extraordinary metabolisms. Their hearts beat 500-1,200 times per minute, and they take 250 breaths per minute. They must eat every 10-15 minutes to survive.

To conserve energy at night, hummingbirds enter a state called torpor, slowing their metabolism dramatically. Their body temperature can drop from 105°F to as low as 65°F. In the morning, it takes about 20 minutes for them to "wake up" and warm up.

## Species Diversity

Over 330 species of hummingbirds exist, ranging from the 5-centimeter Bee Hummingbird (the world's smallest bird) to the 23-centimeter Giant Hummingbird. North America has about 15 breeding species, with the Ruby-throated Hummingbird most common in the east.

The Rufous Hummingbird makes the longest migration of any hummingbird - up to 3,000 miles from Alaska to Mexico. Anna's Hummingbirds are year-round residents along the Pacific coast. Many species display stunning iridescent throat patches called gorgets.

Male hummingbirds are typically more colorful than females, using their brilliant plumage to attract mates. Females are often more camouflaged to protect them while nesting. Many species show different colors depending on the angle of light.

## Creating a Hummingbird Garden

Hummingbirds are attracted to tubular flowers, especially red and orange ones. Excellent plants include bee balm, cardinal flower, trumpet vine, salvia, and fuchsia. Native plants are best as they've co-evolved with local hummingbird species.

Plan for continuous blooming from early spring through fall. Include different flower heights and shapes. Hummingbirds also eat small insects and spiders for protein, so avoid pesticides in your garden.

Provide a water source - hummingbirds enjoy misting from a fountain or sprinkler. They need perches for resting, so include small twigs and branches. Leave some spider webs intact as hummingbirds use them for nesting material.

## Hummingbird Feeders

Supplement natural food with sugar water feeders. The correct ratio is 4 parts water to 1 part white sugar - never use honey, artificial sweeteners, or red dye. Boil the water to remove chlorine and dissolve sugar, then cool before filling feeders.

Clean feeders thoroughly every 3-5 days, more often in hot weather. Mold and fermented nectar can harm hummingbirds. Use a bottle brush and rinse well - no soap residue should remain.

Place feeders where you can easily see them but also near cover for the birds. Multiple feeders placed out of sight of each other reduce territorial fighting. Bring feeders in at night in bear country.

## Nesting and Lifecycle

Hummingbird nests are tiny cups made of plant down, spider webs, and lichens. They're about the size of a walnut and stretch as the chicks grow. Females build the nest and raise the young alone.

Clutches typically contain 2 eggs, each about the size of a jelly bean. Incubation takes 14-23 days depending on species. Chicks fledge at 18-28 days but may return to the nest to sleep for another week or two.

Young hummingbirds learn to fly and feed themselves quickly. They'll visit feeders alongside adults by midsummer. By fall, most North American species begin their southward migration, often traveling alone rather than in flocks.
