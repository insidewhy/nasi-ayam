Hydrangea Colors

Hydrangeas are like mood rings for your garden. The same plant can produce blue or pink flowers depending on soil pH. Acidic soil creates blue blooms, while alkaline soil produces pink. White hydrangeas remain white regardless of soil conditions.

Gardeners can manipulate flower color by adjusting soil pH with additives. Aluminum sulfate increases acidity for bluer flowers. Lime makes soil more alkaline for pinker blooms. It's like having a customizable flower palette.
