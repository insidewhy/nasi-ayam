The Secret Life of Kittens

When kittens sleep, they often dream. You can tell by their twitching whiskers, paddling paws, and tiny squeaks. Scientists believe they're processing the day's adventures and practicing their hunting skills in dreamland.

Awake, kittens are perpetual motion machines. Everything is a toy - a dust mote, a shadow, a sibling's tail. They pounce, tumble, and zoom around in bursts of energy before suddenly collapsing for another nap.
