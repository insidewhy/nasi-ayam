# Baby Animals That Melt Hearts

## Fawns

Baby deer, called fawns, are born with white spots that help camouflage them in dappled forest sunlight. They spend their first few weeks lying motionless while their mothers forage, relying on their spotted coats and lack of scent to stay hidden from predators.

## Seal Pups

White-coated harp seal pups are some of the most photographed baby animals. Born on Arctic ice, they gain weight rapidly from their mother's rich milk before being weaned at just two weeks old.

## Penguin Chicks

Fluffy penguin chicks huddle together in creches for warmth while their parents fish. Emperor penguin chicks are particularly adorable with their gray down and distinctive white face patches.
