Bunny Binky

A bunny binky is one of the most joyful sights in the animal kingdom. The rabbit suddenly leaps into the air, twists its body, and kicks its feet out before landing and zooming off. It's pure, uncontrollable happiness in motion.

Rabbits binky when they feel safe, healthy, and content. A rabbit doing binkies has everything it needs - good food, comfortable housing, and often some exciting new toy or treat. It's their way of saying life is wonderful.
