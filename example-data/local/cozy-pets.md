# Pets That Love to Snuggle

Some animals seem born for cuddling. These cozy companions seek out warmth and contact, making them perfect for people who want an affectionate pet.

## Ragdoll Cats

Ragdolls go limp with relaxation when picked up, hence their name. These large, fluffy cats follow their owners from room to room and often flop down nearby for companionship. They're gentle, patient, and adore being held.

## Cavalier King Charles Spaniels

These small spaniels were bred specifically to be lap warmers. They're happiest curled up next to their favorite person, and their silky ears are perfect for stroking. Cavaliers get along with everyone and adapt to any lifestyle.

## Guinea Pigs

Guinea pigs are surprisingly cuddly. When comfortable, they'll settle into your lap and purr contentedly while being petted. Their soft fur and gentle nature make them wonderful companions for quiet snuggle sessions.
