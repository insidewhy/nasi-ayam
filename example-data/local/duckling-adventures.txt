Duckling Adventures

Baby ducks are fluffy balls of determination. Within hours of hatching, they're ready to follow their mother, swim, and search for food. Their downy feathers are water-resistant, keeping them buoyant and warm.

Ducklings imprint on the first moving thing they see after hatching, which is usually their mother. This strong bond keeps them safe as they waddle through the world, learning everything they need to know from her example.
