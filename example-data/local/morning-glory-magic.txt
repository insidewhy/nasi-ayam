Morning Glory Magic

Morning glories greet each day by unfurling their trumpet-shaped blooms at dawn. By afternoon, they close again, making way for tomorrow's fresh flowers. This daily ritual has charmed gardeners for centuries.

These climbing vines can grow up to 15 feet in a single season, covering fences and trellises in heart-shaped leaves and colorful blooms. Heavenly Blue is the most popular variety, but morning glories also come in purple, pink, red, and white.
