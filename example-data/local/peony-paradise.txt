Peony Paradise

Peonies are the divas of the flower garden, and they earn every bit of their dramatic reputation. Their enormous, ruffled blooms can reach the size of dinner plates, and their fragrance is legendary - sweet, rosy, and utterly intoxicating.

These long-lived perennials can bloom for decades once established. Some peonies in botanical gardens are over 100 years old. They're slow to establish but well worth the wait, often becoming treasured heirlooms passed down through generations.
