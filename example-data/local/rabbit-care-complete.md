# Complete Rabbit Care Guide

Rabbits are delightful pets that bring joy with their curious personalities and adorable antics. Proper care ensures these gentle creatures live happy, healthy lives of 8-12 years.

## Housing Requirements

Indoor housing is safest for pet rabbits. A rabbit's living space should allow at least three to four hops in any direction - bigger is always better. Many rabbit owners use exercise pens or dedicate a bunny-proofed room.

The flooring should be solid, not wire, as wire can hurt rabbit feet and cause sore hocks. Line the area with hay, fleece blankets, or rabbit-safe mats. Include a hiding house where your rabbit can retreat when feeling stressed.

Litter boxes should be large enough for the rabbit to sit in comfortably. Use paper-based litter - never clumping cat litter or cedar shavings, which are dangerous for rabbits. Place hay near the litter box as rabbits like to eat while doing their business.

## Diet and Nutrition

Hay is the most important part of a rabbit's diet, making up about 80% of what they eat. Timothy hay is ideal for adult rabbits; alfalfa hay is only appropriate for young or underweight rabbits due to its high calcium content.

Fresh vegetables should be offered daily - about 2 cups of leafy greens per 6 pounds of body weight. Good options include romaine lettuce, cilantro, parsley, and bok choy. Introduce new vegetables slowly to avoid digestive upset.

Pellets should be fed in limited quantities - about 1/4 cup per 6 pounds of body weight daily. Choose timothy-based pellets without added seeds or colored pieces. Fresh, clean water must always be available.

## Health and Wellness

Find a rabbit-savvy veterinarian before you need one. Rabbits should be spayed or neutered for health and behavioral benefits. Annual check-ups help catch health problems early.

Watch for signs of illness: not eating, lethargy, discharge from eyes or nose, or changes in droppings. GI stasis, where the digestive system slows or stops, is a common emergency requiring immediate veterinary care.

Rabbits need their nails trimmed every 4-6 weeks. Their teeth grow continuously and should be checked regularly. Providing unlimited hay and appropriate chew toys helps keep teeth worn properly.

## Behavior and Enrichment

Rabbits are most active at dawn and dusk. They need several hours of exercise outside their enclosure daily. A rabbit-proofed area allows safe exploration - cover wires, remove toxic plants, and block access to furniture undersides.

Rabbits are intelligent and enjoy mental stimulation. Provide toys like untreated wood blocks, paper bags, and cardboard tubes. Food puzzles encourage natural foraging behavior.

Social animals, rabbits often enjoy companionship of another rabbit. Bonding rabbits requires patience and proper introduction. All rabbits in a pair or group should be spayed/neutered to prevent breeding and reduce territorial behavior.

## Understanding Rabbit Communication

Binkying - jumping and twisting in the air - indicates extreme happiness. Tooth purring (gentle teeth grinding) shows contentment. Thumping warns of perceived danger.

A relaxed rabbit lies flat with back legs extended behind (the "dead bunny flop"). Chinning objects marks them as the rabbit's territory. Grooming you shows trust and affection.

Signs of fear or aggression include growling, boxing with front paws, and showing teeth. Learn to read your rabbit's body language to understand their needs and emotions.
