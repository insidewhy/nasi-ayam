Rainbows After Rain

A rainbow appears when sunlight enters water droplets and bends, separating into its component colors. Red is always on the outside of the arc, violet on the inside. Sometimes, if conditions are right, you might see a double rainbow with the colors reversed on the second arc.

Every rainbow is unique to the observer. The rainbow you see is created by different water droplets than the one your friend sees standing next to you. In a way, every rainbow is your own personal light show.
