Sleeping Puppies

Puppies sleep 18-20 hours a day, and they're not being lazy - they're growing. During sleep, their bodies release growth hormones, their brains process new experiences, and their immune systems strengthen.

The positions puppies sleep in reveal a lot about how they feel. Curled up means they're conserving warmth and protecting themselves. Sprawled out means they're completely comfortable and trust their environment.
