The Magic of Spring Blooms

When the first crocuses push through late winter snow, gardeners everywhere feel their hearts lift. These tiny flowers, in purple, white, and yellow, signal that the long wait for spring is nearly over. They're followed by snowdrops with their delicate nodding heads, then cheerful clusters of grape hyacinths.

Daffodils are perhaps the quintessential spring flower. Their sunny yellow trumpets announce that spring has truly arrived. Planted in sweeping drifts, they naturalize and multiply over the years, creating increasingly impressive displays. Poets have celebrated them for centuries, and it's easy to see why.

Tulips bring the most dramatic spring color. From the delicate species tulips that look like wild flowers to the flamboyant parrot tulips with their feathered petals, there's a tulip for every taste. They come in every color except true blue, including dramatic near-black varieties and multi-colored flames.

As spring progresses, flowering trees join the display. Cherry blossoms create clouds of pink and white, magnolias open their waxy cups, and crabapples shower their petals like confetti. Underneath, forget-me-nots, bleeding hearts, and Virginia bluebells fill the gaps.
