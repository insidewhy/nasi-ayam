Succulent Love

Succulents have become beloved houseplants for good reason. Their chunky leaves store water, making them forgiving of forgetful waterers. They come in an incredible array of shapes, colors, and textures, from the perfect rosettes of echeveria to the trailing strings of pearls.

These desert plants actually prefer neglect to fussing. Overwatering is the most common cause of succulent death. A bright window, well-draining soil, and water only when completely dry are all they need to thrive.
