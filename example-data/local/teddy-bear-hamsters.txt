Syrian Hamsters: The Original Teddy Bears

Syrian hamsters, also called teddy bear hamsters, are the largest and most popular pet hamster species. Their round bodies, small ears, and fluffy coats make them irresistibly cuddly-looking. Unlike dwarf hamsters, Syrians must live alone as adults - they're fiercely territorial and will fight other hamsters.

These nocturnal cuties spend their nights running on wheels, burrowing in bedding, and stuffing their adorably expandable cheek pouches with food. A single Syrian can store enough food in its cheeks to equal half its body weight. In the wild, they'd carry this food back to their elaborate underground burrow systems.

Syrian hamsters come in many colors and coat types. Golden is the original wild color, but breeders have developed black, cream, white, grey, and multi-colored varieties. Long-haired Syrians have flowing fur that needs regular grooming, while short-haired varieties are lower maintenance.

With proper care including a large cage, exercise wheel, and varied diet, Syrian hamsters live 2-3 years. Their relatively short lifespan makes them good pets for learning responsibility, and their gentle, handleable nature makes them excellent first pets for older children.
