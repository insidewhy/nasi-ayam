Wildflower Meadows

Walking through a wildflower meadow in summer is like stepping into a painting. Purple coneflowers sway alongside yellow black-eyed Susans. Orange butterfly weed attracts monarchs while pink milkweed provides food for their caterpillars.

The buzz of bees and flutter of butterflies create a symphony of movement. Each flower has evolved its own strategy for attracting pollinators, from bright colors to sweet nectar to landing platforms perfect for tired insects.
